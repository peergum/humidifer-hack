Pure Enrichment humidifer reverse engineering and hack

## Description

The Pure Enrichment humidifier is a simple product with a touch button and a blue LED and 5 different modes that are cycled through by touching the button:
- OFF
- button lit, LED off, low mist
- button lit, LED on, low mist
- button lit, LED on, high mist
- button lit, LED off, high mist

The humidifier does its job, but I thought it could do more, by interfacing it with wifi to remote control or schedule it and possibly using an RGB LED for more color fun.. These features are usually available in more expensive products, but could be built in for a low cost.

## Price / availability

I bought mine on Amazon for CAD 49.99: [link here](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B013IJPTFK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=sapna03-20&linkId=e998f7c8f139c8549e82412ab4dca27b&language=en_CA)
